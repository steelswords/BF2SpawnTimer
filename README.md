# BF2SpawnTimer
Spawn Timer for Arduino

In the original Star Wars Battlefront 2 game (2005), spawns are allowed every
15 seconds. This is to help me catch those sweet, sweet 2-3 second spawns instead
of just missing them and having to hang around as a ghost for an annoying 10-15 seconds.

# Hardware
Uses an Arduino Uno and a [16 x 2 LCD display shield with buttons](https://www.linksprite.com/wiki/index.php5?title=16_X_2_LCD_Keypad_Shield_for_Arduino) for display,
with an optional green LED connected in series with a resistor to pin 13 to indicate a spawn wait time of only a few seconds.
